# 65emu2

This is a work-in-progress software emulator for the popular but dated 6502 CPU used in many popular systems like the
Atari 2600, C64, NES, Apple I & II and the like. It is a hobby project to get a better grasp on assembly (even though
this one deviates quite a bit from x86/arm) and computer architecture. As I don't have an extensive knowledge in
electrical engineering the best I can do is writing an emulator at least.
